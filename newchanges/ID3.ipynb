    "## 1. Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "A Decision Tree classifier was developed to predict cardiac pathology (Normal vs. Anormal) in children using 7 features selected from multivariate analysis. The dataset of 12,076 patients (64.3% Normal, 35.7% Anormal) was split into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets.\n",

    "- Missing values imputed: FC, IMC, PA_SISTOLICA (median); categorical features ('Missing' category)\n",
    "- Categorical variables label-encoded (3 SOPRO categories, 6 MOTIVO1, 10 MOTIVO2, 3 B2)\n",
    "- Class imbalance addressed through balanced class weights\n",

    "### 4.2 Critical Finding\n",
    "\n",
    "**SOPRO accounts for 92.26% of predictive power** - The Decision Tree essentially uses SOPRO as the primary decision criterion, with other features providing minor refinements.\n",

    "### 5.1 Root Node (Level 1)\n",
    "**First split: SOPRO ≤ 0.5**\n",
    "- **True branch (SOPRO = Alterado/Abnormal):** 2,662 samples → Majority Anormal\n",
    "- **False branch (SOPRO = Normal/Missing):** 5,791 samples → Majority Normal\n",
    "\n",
    "The tree immediately separates patients based on heart murmur presence, achieving substantial class separation at the root.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.2 Level 2 - Left Branch (Abnormal Murmur)\n",
    "**Second split: FC ≤ 80.5**\n",
    "- High heart rate (FC > 80.5) + abnormal murmur → Strong Anormal prediction\n",
    "- Lower heart rate → Further evaluation with FC and MOTIVO2\n",
    "\n",
    "Abnormal murmur combined with elevated heart rate is a strong pathology indicator.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.3 Level 2 - Right Branch (Normal Murmur)\n",
    "**Second split: B2 ≤ 0.5**\n",
    "- **B2 = Alterada (Abnormal second heart sound):** 75 samples → Anormal despite normal murmur\n",
    "- **B2 = Normal/Missing:** 5,716 samples → Predominantly Normal\n",
    "\n",
    "Even without murmur, abnormal second heart sound suggests pathology.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.4 Lower Levels (3-5)\n",
    "Further refinements use:\n",
    "- **FC thresholds** (73.0, 79.0, 87.0, 95.5) - Heart rate boundaries\n",
    "- **IMC threshold** (27.5) - Separates higher BMI cases\n",

    "4. **Class imbalance:** 64% Normal vs. 36% Anormal—handled with balanced weights but could affect rare pathology detection\n",

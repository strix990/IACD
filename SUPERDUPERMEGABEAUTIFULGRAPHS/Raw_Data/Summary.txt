###  **1. Histograms (Frequency Distributions)**

These plots show how frequently values occur for each numeric attribute.

* **Peso (Weight):** The histogram shows a strong right skew — many low values and few very large ones. This suggests most entries cluster at low weights with a few extreme outliers.
* **Altura (Height):** The values are distributed more widely, with a plateau-like region between roughly 50 and 150. This indicates multiple common value ranges.
* **IMC (BMI):** Most data points are concentrated at very low values, with a few extremely high ones pushing the axis scale far to the right.
* **PA Sistólica (Systolic BP)** and **PA Diastólica (Diastolic BP):** Both show that most observations lie in a narrow, realistic range, but there are rare extreme cases extending up to very high values (e.g., near 1000 for systolic).

Overall, histograms make the **data concentration and outliers** immediately visible.

### **2. Density Plots (Probability Distributions)**

These show smoothed versions of the histograms — continuous curves estimating the **probability density** of the data.

* The sharp peaks you saw (especially in IMC and blood pressure) indicate that most values fall within a very tight interval, while the long flat tails confirm the presence of extreme outliers stretching the x-axis.
* **Altura** shows multiple humps — suggesting multimodality (potentially different subgroups or measurement ranges).
* **Peso** and **PA Diastólica** display narrow peaks near their mean values, meaning low variability among most observations.

Density plots help visualize the **shape and smoothness** of distributions — even when histograms look blocky.

### **3. Spread Measures (Descriptive Statistics Table)**

This table summarizes numerical variability and central tendency for each attribute:

| Attribute         | Interpretation                                                                                                                            |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Peso**          | Mean ≈ 21.2, high std (18.1), with a range of 197 → indicates considerable spread and likely outliers (since weight can’t be negative).   |
| **Altura**        | Mean ≈ 83.9, wide std (56.6), range 198 → data vary greatly; possibly includes missing or coded values (e.g., 0).                         |
| **IMC**           | Mean ≈ 17.8, std ≈ 12.1, but max = 848 → a few extreme values dominate the range; most entries are likely within normal human BMI limits. |
| **PA Sistólica**  | Mean ≈ 101, std ≈ 15.5, but max = 990 → typical blood pressure values clustered near 100 with rare data-entry spikes.                     |
| **PA Diastólica** | Mean ≈ 62, std ≈ 8.9, reasonable range up to 120, indicating normal dispersion.                                                           |

Together, these stats quantify **central tendency (mean, median)** and **dispersion (std, range)** — matching what you visually observed in the plots.

## Main Changes Needed in the Raw Data

### 1. Handle Clearly Invalid or Impossible Values

* Negative “Peso” (Weight):
  You have weights as low as –40, which is impossible.
  → Replace negative values with `NaN` or remove those records entirely.

* Zero or Unrealistic “Altura” (Height):
  A height of 0 is physically impossible and skews IMC (BMI) calculation.
  → Treat zeros as missing (`NaN`) and remove or impute later.

* Extremely High “IMC” (848):
  BMI above 100 is biologically implausible.
  → Cap these at a reasonable human maximum (for example, 60) or remove them as outliers.

* Very High “PA Sistólica” (990) and “PA Diastólica” (120+):
  Normal human systolic values rarely exceed 250 mmHg.
  → Anything above about 300 should be flagged or removed.

---

### 2. Check for Unit Inconsistencies

The range of “Altura” (0–198) and “Peso” (–40 to 157) suggests mixed measurement units (for example, cm vs. m, kg vs. g).
→ Verify that all measurements use the same units and convert if necessary.
Example: if some heights are in meters (1.80) and others in centimeters (180), this will distort both “Altura” and “IMC”.

---

### 3. Inspect and Correct Derived Columns

IMC (BMI) = Peso / (Altura²). If this was calculated automatically, invalid Peso/Altura values propagate to IMC.
→ Recalculate IMC only after cleaning “Peso” and “Altura”.
This will remove unnatural spikes and compress the range to realistic values (approximately 10–60).

---

### 4. Remove or Impute Missing or Extreme Values

Use quantile thresholds or z-scores to identify extreme outliers:

```python
df = df[(df['Peso'].between(df['Peso'].quantile(0.01), df['Peso'].quantile(0.99)))]
```

→ This trims extreme 1% tails while keeping realistic data intact.
Alternatively, set them to `NaN` and impute later using median or regression models.

---

### 5. Re-examine Data Collection or Entry Process

The large spread and unrealistic values suggest manual entry or import errors.
→ Implement validation at data collection (for example, reject negative or zero height, implausible pressure values).

---

### 6. Verify Data Type Consistency

Ensure all numeric columns are actually numeric (`float` or `int`) — sometimes Excel imports numbers as strings with commas or spaces.
→ Run:

```python
df = df.apply(pd.to_numeric, errors='coerce')
```

to coerce bad entries into `NaN`.

###### STILL LOVE ERIS CHUU CHUU 
##### So, as I talked with Ines, I should not make up values and only remove ones that are medically impossible.
##### Also, remove data that has the age atribute x> 19 or x < 2, as a side note if out of imc, peso and altura
##### a given entry has only one of them missing I should recalculate the value based on the other two attributes

The main difference between an abstract and an interface in Java would be that an Interface has to have
its methods declared and certainly not innitialized, while an abstract can have its methods, or variables
for that matter, properly innitialized
